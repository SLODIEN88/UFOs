## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana create a webpage to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. I was able to do that, but also added filters for other criterias like City, State and Shape

## Results

As seen above, the webpage was filtered only on a date filter where users specified a date and clicked on the button. With the new updated version, we added other filters as seen below with city, state, country. Upon the users utilizing the filter buttons, the table will automatically filter results accordingly

## Summary

Overall, the webpage is very user friendly, but it also has its disadvantages. Currently, I feel like the background color is too dark and not appealing to the eye. It is also can not be resized in relation to the device it is viewed on.
